RESERVE DAY\\nThe hours of play on the Reserve Day shall be the same as on the scheduled day for \\nthe match (including the extra time provision). \\nIf play is interrupted on the scheduled day, the umpires shall use the available extra \\ntime and, if necessary, reduce the number of overs to try to achieve a result on that day. \\nEach team must have had the opportunity to bat for a minimum of 20 overs for a \\nresult to be achieved. If play has not resumed by the cut-off time required to allow \\nthe minimum number of overs to be bowled to achieve a result on the scheduled \\nday, play shall be abandoned for the day and the Reserve Day shall be used to \\ncomplete the match. \\nOn the Reserve Day, play shall recommence under the same assumption that the \\nlast ball was bowled on the scheduled day. \\nThe match starts when the coin toss takes place and teams are exchanged. If the \\ntoss occurs on the scheduled day and there is no play thereafter, the result of the \\ntoss and the named teams shall be carried through to the Reserve Day. \\nIn making their decisions in relation to ground, weather and light, the umpires shall \\naim to maximize play on the scheduled day of the match in order to achieve a result \\non that day, as if there was no Reserve Day available. \\nThe treatment of the pitch on the Reserve Day by the Ground Authority shall be  \\nas follows:\\n•\\t Covering\\tand\\tremoval\\tof\\tcovers\\t–\\tas\\tfor\\tthe\\tscheduled\\tday\\tof\\tthe\\tmatch\\tunder\\t\\nclause 10 of the Playing Conditions; and\\n•\\t Mowing\\tand\\trolling\\t–\\tas\\tfor\\tDay\\t2\\tof\\ta\\tTest\\tMatch,\\tunder\\tclause\\t9\\tof\\tthe\\tICC\\tTest\\t\\nMatch Playing Conditions. \\nExample 1: Match starts at 50 overs per side and there is an interruption at 19 \\novers. Overs are reduced to 46 overs per side and play is about to resume. Before \\nanother ball is bowled it rains and play is abandoned for the day. As the match did \\nnot resume under the revised overs, the match should continue on the Reserve \\nDay at the original 50 overs per side with the overs reduced if necessary during the \\nReserve Day. \\nExample 2: The same start as in example 1 i.e. match starts at 50 overs per side and \\nthere is an interruption at 19 overs. Overs are reduced to 46 overs per side and play \\nis about to resume. This time, play starts and after an over has been bowled it rains \\nand play is abandoned for the day.

Historically, \\nthe regulation of what constitutes a legal bowling action has been governed by \\nLaw 21.2 of the Laws of Cricket, which state:\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be thrown; and\\nA ball is fairly delivered in respect of the arm if, once the bowler’s arm has reached \\nthe level of the shoulder in the delivery swing, the elbow joint is not straightened \\npartially\\tor\\tcompletely\\tfrom\\tthat\\tpoint\\tuntil\\tthe\\tball\\thas\\tleft\\tthe\\thand.\\tThis\\tdefinition\\t\\nshall\\tnot\\tdebar\\ta\\tbowler\\tfrom\\tflexing\\tor\\trotating\\tthe\\twrist\\tin\\tthe\\tdelivery\\tswing.\\nScientific\\tresearch\\trevealed\\tthat\\talmost\\tall\\tbowling\\tactions\\tcontained\\tsome\\tdegree\\t\\nof straightening at the elbow (referred to in these Illegal Bowling Regulations as \\n“Elbow Extension”). In theory, therefore, the vast majority of bowlers, with actions \\nconsidered by umpires to be legal under the Laws of Cricket, were contravening \\nLaw 21.2 each time they delivered the ball. It was also demonstrated in studies \\nby human movement specialists that such Elbow Extension in a bowling action \\nbecame\\tnoticeable\\tto\\tthe\\tnaked\\teye\\t–\\tand\\tstarted\\tto\\tlook\\tlike\\ta\\tthrow\\t–\\twhen\\tit\\t\\nexceeded 15 degrees.\\nIn order to ensure that the intention behind Law 21.2 was upheld and that \\nthe distinction between bowling and throwing the ball remained, the ICC has \\nintroduced regulations stipulating a maximum degree of permitted Elbow \\nExtension in a bowling action. As with other regulations and Playing Conditions \\nissued by the ICC, these Illegal Bowling Regulations modify the Laws of Cricket  \\nas applied to cricket played under the ICC’s jurisdiction.\\nAn\\tIllegal\\tBowling\\tAction\\tis\\tdefined\\tin\\tthese\\tIllegal\\tBowling\\tRegulations\\tas\\ta\\t\\nbowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, measured \\nfrom the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at \\nwhich the ball is released (any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the \\npurposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action).\\nThese Illegal Bowling Regulations have therefore been adopted and implemented \\nby the ICC for the following reasons:\\ni) to provide a consistent framework for the regulation of bowling actions;\\nii)\\t to\\tensure\\ta\\tlevel\\tplaying\\tfield\\tfor\\tcricket\\tplayed\\tunder\\tthe\\tICC’s\\tjurisdiction,\\t  \\nby ensuring that bowlers are not able to gain potential advantages through \\nthe use of an Illegal Bowling Action; \\niii)\\t to\\tprovide\\ta\\tprocedure\\tunder\\twhich\\tboth\\tsuspected\\tand\\tconfirmed\\tIllegal\\t\\nBowling\\tActions\\tin\\tInternational\\tCricket\\tcan\\tbe\\tdealt\\twith\\tfairly,\\tefficiently\\t\\nand with certainty; and\\niv) to coordinate the approach taken in domestic cricket to the testing of \\nsuspected\\tIllegal\\tBowling\\tActions\\t–\\tand\\tthe\\tconsequences\\tof\\tconfirmed\\t\\nIllegal\\tBowling\\tActions\\t–\\tbetween\\tNational\\tCricket\\tFederations\\tand\\tthe\\tICC.\\n Unless otherwise indicated, references to Articles, Annexures and Appendices \\nare to provisions of these Illegal Bowling Regulations.

Each case must be considered \\non its own facts and the ICC will take into account all relevant circumstances, \\nincluding\\t(as\\tit\\tsees\\tfit):\\t(a)\\tthe\\tviews\\tof\\tany\\tother\\trelevant\\tteam\\tor\\tindividual;\\t\\n(b) the likely sentiment and response in the media to the message in all relevant \\ncountries; (c) whether the message is a ‘one-off’ or whether it is to be displayed \\nfor a longer period; (d) the purpose and impact of conveying the message. By \\nway of example only, and without limitation, where the purpose of a message \\nappears to be commemorative in nature (e.g. the use of a black armband or a \\npoppy) or to serve a charitable purpose (e.g. to generate funds or awareness \\nfor a non-political charitable cause), it is more likely to be permitted; where \\na message appears to indicate support for a particular government, political \\nparty or individual, it is more likely to be prohibited.
